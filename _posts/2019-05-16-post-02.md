---

## Paper info
Chen D W, Miao R, Yang W Q, et al. A Feature Extraction Method Based on Differential Entropy and Linear Discriminant Analysis for Emotion Recognition[J]. Sensors, 2019, 19(7): 1631.

## Notes

- Existing features: spectral density, logarithmic power, Hjorth parameters, wavelet transform
- This paper proposes a feature extraction method based on the **fusion** of differential entropy and LDA.
- 使用了SEED数据，但是结果似乎并不好，至少没有我们目前的好。
